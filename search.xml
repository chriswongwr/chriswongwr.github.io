    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Generally, there are two types of Quant job - developer, and research analyst. On the one hand, quant developer are very similar to programmer. So the interview questions programming-orientated, that is to say, you don’t need to have Finance knowledge. While for Quant research analyst, the interview questions are testing for research ability. Most of the firms will assign a mini case to you and ask you how to research/analyze on that. And this blog are mainly concentrate on the interview for Quant Researcher.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I. Quant Investing Background 量化投资背景 Quant is the abbreviation of Quantitative, meaning relating to, measuring, or measured by the quantity of something rather than its quality, according to its definition. Quantitative Investing, or Quant Investing is an investment method that applies mathematics, statistics and computer science to Finance fields.Recently, Big data, machine learning become a new research field of quant investing. It seems that those techniques are very power. However, the truth is that many machine learning methods are overfit the financial data; since financial data have lots of noise, machine learning methods will always fit the noise instead of meaningful feartures. With more and more advance research in deep learning(ARR,NRR…), some data scientists indeed figure out some methods to overcome the problems of overfitting. II. Quant Investing Procedures 量化投资的过程There is no secret formula or strategy for quant investing. Just like a Phd student! No one knows the answer, even your boss. Thus, the only way is backtest. Before you could actually begin you research and investing, you need the following things: 1. DataData is the first cornerstone for quant investing. Just as a saying goes, “Garbage in, garbage out”. If the data is unreliable, everything based on the data is garbage. So please pay lots of attention to data and make sure you could process the source data clean and accurate. The quality of your data determines your investing results. I will write more about data in later blogs.&lt;&gt;A typical data structure like this: Time open high low close volume P/E … 20170101 10.00 10:48 9.89 10.23 121324 25.23 … 2. Strategy LogicSelect a direction of you strategy. And you gotta know the logic behind the strategies. These strategies comes from differ sources, such as former experience, research assumptions(Brownian Motion), Efficient Markets Hypothesis, and arbitrage theorem. I will expand this discussion in Part III. 3. Trading System(Execute)For a simple trading system, it consists of at least three parts: order management, order execution, and execute algorithm. Notice that the “execute algorithm” here only refer to order split algorithms. For example, if you want to buy 1 million shares of AAPL, this execute algorithm will divide 1 million shares to lots of small orders, so that other investors cannot observe the strong demand and the order can have a better execution price. Typical execute algo inclues VWAP and TWAP, etc. 4. Visual and evaluation System(GUI)A typical Quant Investing Procedures are like this: III. Quant Investing Strategies 量化投资策略分类Many Quant Strategies are based on original trading strategies, including technical analysis model. Quant(computer scientists) just apply those “Old” strategies in the computer-based system. While thanks to many mathematicians, statistics, and data scientist, many new strategies are invented and works really well. For this generation, everyone could create its own strategies and make a profit, but before that, we still need the building blocks to design our own strategies. Stock selection 量化择股Time selection 量化择时In short, time selection is very similar to Stock selection. Rather, time selection is to figure when to buy in and when to exit one or more stocks. This strategy has a basic assumption: there is market timing in the financial market. For more info about market timing, please refer to Li’s essay. Assuming market timing exist, this is, we could make a profit by predicting the time to enter/exit market. Logically, when the market works well, we enter; before the market performs poorly, we exit. We mainly use four dimensions to predict the when is a good time to enter: leading macroeconomics index, technical analysis,fundamental analysis, and sentiment level. A simple example for markting timing strategy is simple moving average, SMA. Click the link for more info.

    <url>%2F2017%2F07%2F21%2FStudy-Notes-ISLR%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, namely ISLR, is the “bible” of machine learning(statistical learning). This book is one of my favorite textbook at LSE, where one of my professor have got involved in the writing process. You can download this book online for completely free at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/. Well, unfortunately, ISLR is based on R instead of Python. So as a study notes, I am not going to translate or rephrase this book. Rather I am going to try to use Python to replicate the processes and machine learning methods. Hope you enjoy.]]></content>
